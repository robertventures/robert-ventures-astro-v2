# GEO-BLOCKING: Webinar Registration API
# ========================================
# Block all countries except US and Colombia from registering for webinars
# This prevents spam registrations (commonly from Europe/Moscow timezone)
# Blocked users receive a 403 error; frontend handles this gracefully
# and does NOT fire Meta Pixel or GA4 conversion events
