    <h2><strong>Strategies for Portfolio Risk Management</strong></h2>
    <p>Effective portfolio risk management strategies can help investors protect their wealth, optimize returns, and
        improve long-term investment performance. Some common strategies include:</p>
    <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Diversification involves spreading investments across various asset
            classes, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce the impact of any single risk factor on the portfolio.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Asset Allocation:</strong> Asset allocation is the process of determining the optimal mix of
            different asset classes within a portfolio based on an investor&#x27;s risk tolerance, investment horizon,
            and financial goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebalancing:</strong> Rebalancing involves adjusting the portfolio&#x27;s asset allocation
            periodically to maintain the desired risk level and return potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Hedging:</strong> Hedging involves using financial instruments, such as derivatives or other
            investment strategies, to reduce or offset the risk of adverse price movements in the portfolio.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk-Adjusted Returns:</strong> Risk-adjusted returns involve evaluating investment performance by
            considering both the return and the level of risk involved. This approach helps investors compare
            investments and make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis:</strong> Stress testing and scenario analysis involve
            assessing the potential impact of adverse market conditions or specific risk events on the investment
            portfolio. This helps investors identify potential vulnerabilities and make adjustments to their risk
            management strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Use of Derivatives and Structured Products:</strong> Derivatives and structured products, such as
            options, futures, and swaps, can be used to manage portfolio risk by providing exposure to specific assets,
            sectors, or market conditions while limiting potential losses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Role of Risk Tolerance in Portfolio Risk Management</strong></h2>
    <p>Risk tolerance is the level of risk an investor is willing to accept in pursuit of their investment goals. It is
        influenced by factors such as investment horizon, financial goals, and personal temperament. Assessing risk
        tolerance involves evaluating an investor&#x27;s financial situation, goals, and preferences to determine the
        appropriate level of risk for their investment portfolio. Aligning risk tolerance with investment strategy
        ensures that the portfolio&#x27;s risk profile is consistent with the investor&#x27;s goals and preferences,
        optimizing the balance between risk and return.</p>
    <h2><strong>Importance of Periodic Portfolio Reviews</strong></h2>
    <p>Evaluating investment performance and assessing the effectiveness of risk management strategies are crucial
        aspects of periodic portfolio reviews. Regular reviews help investors determine whether their risk management
        strategies are effectively mitigating risks and aligning with their financial goals and risk tolerance. As
        market conditions and risk factors evolve, investors need to adjust their portfolios and risk management
        strategies to maintain an optimal balance between risk and return.</p>
    <p>As a rule of thumb, doing a portfolio review on a quarterly basis is a good frequency to be adopted for
        investors. This way, it&#x27;s possible to understand the directions of the market over a short period of time
        and adapt your allocation accordingly. The minimum recommendation is that this is performed once a year.<br />

        performance and achieve their financial goals while minimizing potential losses. Implementing effective risk
