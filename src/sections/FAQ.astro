                            For any investment/allocation decision, you should
                            always answer to those questions:<br />
                            - Do I believe in the asset class I am about to invest?<br
                            />
                            - Do I like the expected returns?<br />
                            - Do they make sense to my portfolio?<br />
                            - Do I trust the manager?<br />
                            Our product is made for qualified investors who intend
                            to outpace inflation and earn high yields, especially
                            given the current macroeconomic conditions.<br />

                            The bonds are structured to eliminate intermediary fees
                            and reduce overall expenses, meaning any additional fees
                            do not reduce your monthly payments.<br />
                            Bondholders can be confident that excessive fees and
                            expenses do not impact their returns. Transparency and
                            fairness are crucial elements in building trust with
                            our investors, and this fee structure reflects that commitment.<br
