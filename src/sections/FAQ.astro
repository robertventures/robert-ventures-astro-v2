        question: "Is it FDIC-insured? What's the real risk?",
        answer: `FDIC insurance only applies to bank deposits, such as savings accounts, not to most investments people already own, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and REITs.<br/>
        Like any investment, there's risk. We mitigate this risk through diversification in real estate and blue-chip digital assets. Additionally, our CEO, Joe Robert, has over 20 years of experience, has raised over $10 million in past offerings, and has never missed a payment. One in four investors reinvest within ~40 days, typically with four times their initial amount.`,
    },
    {
        question: "How can we realistically pay 10% in this market?",
        answer: `Our real estate projects in the Outer Banks target annualized returns of 10% or more, and we also generate long-term growth from investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both sectors have delivered double-digit returns over time, and we don't rely on leverage.<br/>
        The 10% rate is achievable because we operate efficiently, investing only when the timing and demand are right. We build on lots as the market demands it, and if conditions cool, we can shift capital into digital assets instead of being forced to deploy it like significant funds.`,
    },
    {
        question: "Are There Any Fees?",
        answer: `No. Our bonds are designed with zero intermediary or management fees, so nothing is taken from your monthly payments. This structure ensures that your returns are sent directly to you and reflects our commitment to transparency and aligning our interests with yours.`,
    },
    {
        question: "How Are My Investments Taxed? ",
        answer: `Robert Ventures' investments are taxed the same as any other high-yield bond or interest-bearing investment. You will receive a Form 1099-INT at the beginning of every tax year for the previous year, covering all interest paid during the calendar/tax year.`,
    },
    {
        question: "How experienced is Robert Ventures?",
        answer: `Although this offering is relatively new, having been launched to the public in October 2024 after a year of SEC qualification, it's backed by extensive experience. Over the last 15 years, our manager, Joe Robert, has secured over $10 million from 60 private investors through various partnerships, including Silver Bay Capital. During that time, he has managed 1,500 mortgages and sold 200 properties, completing every offering and repaying investors in full.<br/> 
        Now operating under Robert Ventures, he works directly with investors, offering full transparency, eliminating middlemen, and potentially achieving better yields.`,
    },
    {
        question: "Why are our digital assets as part of our treasuries important in 2025?",
        answer: `We only hold Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two digital assets now used and owned by governments (including the US), pensions, and asset managers like BlackRock, the biggest globally. We don't trade, but hold those assets in our treasuries, like large institutions do.<br/>
        They've been the best-performing assets of the past decade and complement the stability of our real estate. We're preparing ourselves for a digital economy.`,
